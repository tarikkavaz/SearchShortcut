# Privacy Policy for Search Shortcuts Extension

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Overview

Search Shortcuts ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how the Extension handles data.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data is Accessed

The Extension accesses the following data:

- **Selected Text**: When you use a keyboard shortcut or context menu option, the Extension temporarily reads the text you have selected on a web page to perform a search.

### What Data is NOT Collected

The Extension does **NOT**:
- Collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- Track your browsing history
- Monitor your general web activity
- Log keystrokes (except for the specific extension keyboard shortcuts you trigger)
- Access any data beyond the text you explicitly select
- Share data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services

### How Data is Used

Selected text is used **only** to:
- Construct search URLs with your chosen search engines
- Open search results in a new tab or window

The selected text is processed **locally** in your browser and is **never**:
- Stored on disk
- Sent to any server
- Transmitted over the network
- Shared with third parties

### Local Storage

The Extension uses Chrome's local storage API to save your preferences, including:
- Your configured search engines and their URLs
- Display preferences (dark/light mode)
- Other extension settings

This data is stored **locally** on your device and is **never** transmitted or shared. You can delete this data at any time by uninstalling the Extension or clearing your browser's extension data.

## Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access the currently active tab when you trigger a keyboard shortcut
- **contextMenus**: To create a context menu for searching selected text
- **tabs**: To query active tabs and create new tabs for search results
- **storage**: To save your search engine preferences locally
- **scripting**: To retrieve selected text from web pages
- **Host permissions**: To inject a content script that can read selected text when keyboard shortcuts are used

All permissions are used **only** for the Extension's core functionality and **not** for data collection or tracking.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or data collection services.
